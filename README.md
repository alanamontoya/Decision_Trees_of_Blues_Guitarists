# Decision_Trees_of_Blues_Guitarists

Summary:

*	Predicted an artistâ€™s birth year based on hand postures, thumb styles, and region they live in.
*	Fit decision trees and random forest models using 5-fold stratified cross-validation in Python to determine whether the artist was born after 1906.
*	Concluded that since the models produced a low average test accuracy (between 53% and 59%), more data may be needed to boost model accuracies.
